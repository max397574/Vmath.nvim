✅Usage
-----
`vnoremap <your mapping> <ESC>:Vmath<CR>`

Example:
`vnoremap <leader>vm <ESC>:Vmath<CR>`

⚙️Customization
-------------
You can customize with the following lines in a vim configuration
```lua
lua << EOF
require('vmath_nvim').setup{
-- show these numbers
show_sum = true,
show_average = true,
show_count = true,
show_lowest = true,
show_highest = true,
show_range = true,
show_median = true,
-- show debug info (execution time)
debug = true,
}
EOF
```
And this in a lua configuration:
```lua
require('vmath_nvim').setup{
-- show these numbers
show_sum = true,
show_average = true,
show_count = true,
show_lowest = true,
show_highest = true,
show_range = true,
show_median = true,
-- show debug info (execution time)
debug = true,
}
```

🚫Limitations
-----------
* Currently can't ignore dates
* Only works with full lines (visual-line mode)

💡Future Plans/Ideas
------------------
* Ignore dates
* More mathematical figures
* Save numbers in registers
* Add settings

👀Examples
--------

Extract out of list with text and $-signs
